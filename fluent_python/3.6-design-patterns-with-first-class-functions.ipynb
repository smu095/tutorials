    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In software engineering, a **software design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system."

    "The classic [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) design pattern is summarised like this in [*Design Patterns*](https://www.bookdepository.com/Design-Patterns/9780201633610):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make the interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 6-1.** An online store has the following discount rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customers with 1000 or more fidelity points get a global\n",
    "l 5% discount per order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 10% discount is applied to each line item with 20 or more units in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Order with at least 10 distinct items get a 7% global discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "The participants in the Strategy design pattern are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Context*: Provides a service by delegating some computation to interchangeable components that implement alternative algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Strategy*: The interface common to the components that implement the different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Concrete Strategy*: One of the concrete subclasses of Strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, before instantiating an order, the system would somehow select a promotional discount strategy and pass it to the `Order` constructor. How to do this is beyond the scope of the example."
