    "There are different kinds of operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `+` and `|` are examples of **infix operators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-` and `~` are examples of **unary operators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `()` (function invocation), `.` (attribute access) and `[]` (item access/slicing) are also examples of operators.\n",

    "This chapter deals mainly with infix and unary operators, and will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How Python supports infix operators with operands of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using duck typing or explicit type checks to deal with operands of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How an infix operator method should signal it cannot handle an operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The special behaviour of the rich comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default handling of augmented assignment operators, like `+=`, and how to overload them."
