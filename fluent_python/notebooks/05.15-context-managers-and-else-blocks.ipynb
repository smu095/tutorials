    "\n",
    "Here are the rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**`for/else`:**<br>\n",
    "The `else` block will run only if and when the `for` loop runs to completion (i.e. **not** if the `for` is aborted with a `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`while/else`:**<br>\n",
    "The `else` block will run only if and when the `while` loop exits because the condition became *falsy* (i.e. not when the `while` is aborted with a `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`try/else`:**<br>\n",
    "The `else` block will only run if no exception is raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In all cases, the `else` clause is skipped if an exception or a `return`, `break`, or `continue` statement causes control to jump out of the main block of the compound statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `else` blocks in `for` loops generally follows this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    if item.flavour == \"banana\":\n",
    "        break\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"No banana flavour found\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `try/except` blocks, the `try` block should only have statements that may generate the expected exceptions. Instead of\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    dangerous_call()\n",
    "    after_call()\n",
    "except OSError:\n",
    "    log(\"OSError...\" )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "use the `else` block for clarity and correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    dangerous_call()\n",
    "except OSError:\n",
    "    log(\"OSError...\" )\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    after_call()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `try/except` is commonly used for control flow, and not just for error handling. See e.g. the [offical Python glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **EAFP:**<br>Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by the presence of many `try` and `except` statements. The technique contrasts with the [LBYL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-lbyl) style common to many other languages such as C."

    "\n",
    "The `with` statement sets up a temporary context and reliably tears it down, preventing errors and reducing boilerplate code.\n",

    "The **context manager protocol** exists to control a `with` statement, just like the iterator protocol exists to control a `for` statement.\n",
