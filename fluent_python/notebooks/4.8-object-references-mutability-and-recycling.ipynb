However, until the object is actually destroyed the weak reference may return the object even if there are no strong references to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where itâ€™s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, if you have a number of large binary image objects, you may wish to associate a name with each. If you used a Python dictionary to map names to images, or images to names, the image objects would remain alive just because they appeared as values or keys in the dictionaries. The WeakKeyDictionary and WeakValueDictionary classes supplied by the weakref module are an alternative, using weak references to construct mappings that donâ€™t keep objects alive solely because they appear in the mapping objects. If, for example, an image object is a value in a WeakValueDictionary, then when the last remaining references to that image object are the weak references held by weak mappings, garbage collection can reclaim the object, and its corresponding entries in weak mappings are simply deleted.\n",
