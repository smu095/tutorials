# Learning Python
A repository of educational Python resources. The [Zen of Python (PEP-20)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) states:

> Beautiful is better than ugly. <br> 
Explicit is better than implicit. <br>
Simple is better than complex. <br>
Complex is better than complicated. <br>
Flat is better than nested. <br>
Sparse is better than dense. <br>
Readability counts. <br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br>
Although practicality beats purity. <br>
Errors should never pass silently. <br>
Unless explicitly silenced. <br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <br>
Now is better than never. <br>
Although never is often better than *right* now. <br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <br>
